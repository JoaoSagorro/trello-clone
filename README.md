<h1>Hello everyone</h1>

This project was done by following a tutorial on creating a Trello-clone. Although I didn't develop it myself, I used it to get acquainted with NextJs, ReactJs, Typescript, Tailwind CSS and Prisma.

This project is helping me understand the differences between client rendering and server rendering in ReactJs, it helped me learn how to use APIs to get Unsplash images for example, and it also helped me understand how and why to set types in Typescript and how and why hooks are used in ReactJs.

Additionally, it showed me the different libraries that ReactJs has so I can use them in future projects, like Lucide React and Sonner (for toaster).

Thanks for reading and thanks to "Code with Antonio" for the amazing tutorial.
